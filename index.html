        Hi! My name is Sumedha Saravanakumar and I’m a sophomore at Purdue
        studying Computer Engineering with a concentration in AI and Machine
        Learning. I love building things with code, learning about new
        technologies, and collaborating with others to turn ideas into working
        projects. I also enjoy reading, going on walks (and usually getting
        lost), and attempting all kinds of arts and crafts!

              During my internship last summer, I contributed to the full-stack
              development of scalable web applications using Java, Python, and
              React, while supporting AI-driven cybersecurity projects focused
              on vulnerability detection and system hardening. I also maintained
              AWS EC2 instances for application deployment and testing, and
              participated in testing and quality assurance to identify and
              resolve security flaws. This experience was super rewarding, and I
              learned a lot about integrating AI solutions into real-world
              applications, as well as the importance of feedback and asking for
              help when needed.

              I recently joined Purdue Stack as a full stack developer, where
              I'm a part of a team of other developers and designers. We're
              working on developing a news feed feature for the Social Stock
              Exchange (SSE) mobile app, delivering up-to-the-minute celebrity
              updates and trending content. Our goal is to implement
              personalized feeds, keyword search, and interactive features like
              upvotes and comments to improve user engagement.

              I'm also an undergraduate research assistant in the Video
              Analytics Lab for Daily Living Lab at Purdue. Our research focuses
              on developing and implementing Python-based computer vision models
              to classify and track cows from large-scale image and video
              datasets directly from Purdue's farms! We hope to improve the
              accuracy of object and motion detection models, because better
              algorithms mean better insights for farmers, and happier cows!

              As a part of Purdue’s Boiler Robotics Software team, I work on
              developing and testing various functions the rover. Currently,
              we're implementing computer vision algorithms to analyze
              geological samples and programming a robotic arm using with ROS to
              handle precise tasks like typing and flipping switches. In the
              future, we'll also be working on semi-autonomous rover navigation,
              integrating sensors, and real-time data processing. This is my
              first experience with robotics, and I’m learning a ton about both
              software with hardware systems. Our team is aiming to have the
              rover fully functional by spring 2026 to participate in the
              University Rover Challenge (URC).
