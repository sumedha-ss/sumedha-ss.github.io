        Hi! My name is Sumedha Saravanakumar and I’m a sophomore at Purdue
        studying Computer Engineering with a concentration in AI and Machine
        Learning. I love building things with code, learning about new
        technologies, and collaborating with others to turn ideas into working
        projects. I also enjoy reading, going on walks (and usually getting
        lost), and attempting all kinds of arts and crafts!

              During my internship last summer, I contributed to the full-stack
              development of scalable web applications using Java, Python, and
              React, while supporting AI-driven cybersecurity projects focused
              on vulnerability detection and system hardening. I also maintained
              AWS EC2 instances for application deployment and testing, and
              participated in testing and quality assurance to identify and
              resolve security flaws. This experience was super rewarding, and I
              learned a lot about integrating AI solutions into real-world
              applications, as well as the importance of feedback and asking for
              help when needed.

              developing and testing various functions the rover. Currently,
              we're implementing computer vision algorithms to analyze
              geological samples and programming a robotic arm using with ROS to
              handle precise tasks like typing and flipping switches. In the
              future, we'll also be working on semi-autonomous rover navigation,
              integrating sensors, and real-time data processing. This is my
              first experience with robotics, and I’m learning a ton about both
              software with hardware systems. Our team is aiming to have the
              rover fully functional by spring 2026 to participate in the
              University Rover Challenge (URC).

            Over the summer, I spent a lot of my down time exploring the hills
            and trails near my house. I love going on long walks and hikes, even
            when the California heat is barely tolerable. It's the perfect way
            to clear my mind, appreciate the beauty of nature, and maybe even
            spot a few critters if I'm lucky. I do tend to get lost pretty
            easily, but I also end up discovering new places I probably wouldn't
            have found otherwise!

            I LOVE arts and crafts! I enjoy trying all kinds of DIY projects
            (usually from Pinterest), and I’m always on the lookout for new
            ideas and inspiration. I don't think I have a favorite so far, I
            just like to make physical things with my hands, even though they
            don't always turn out as expected! I took a ceramics class in high
            school, and had so much fun taking home deformed clay objects every
            week. Recently, I've been working on small decorative items for my
            dorm, like the bow garland I made with pink construction paper and
            an absurd amount of staples. No matter how busy school gets, I
            always try to make time for crafting because it's such a relaxing
            way to express myself. I've also joined Purdue's sewing and
            woodcarving clubs this year to help channel my creativity!
