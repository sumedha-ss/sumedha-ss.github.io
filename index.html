        Hi! My name is Sumedha Saravanakumar and I’m a sophomore at Purdue
        studying Computer Engineering with a concentration in AI and Machine
        Learning. I love building things with code, learning about new
        technologies, and collaborating with others to turn ideas into working
        projects. I also enjoy reading, going on walks (and usually getting
        lost), and attempting all kinds of arts and crafts!

              I joined Purdue's ECE Corporate Partnerships Program as a Frontend
              and Backend Software Engineer! In this role, I help build and
              maintain web platforms that support ECE’s industry partnerships
              and student engagement initiatives. I work across the stack using
              React, JavaScript, and Node.js with Express to create intuitive
              user interfaces and scalable backend services backed by REST APIs.
              A big part of my role involves collaborating closely with
              stakeholders to understand their needs, propose technical
              solutions, and iteratively refine features based on feedback. This
              role has been a great opportunity to see how thoughtful software
              design can directly support real partnerships within the ECE
              department.

              on vulnerability detection and system hardening. I also maintained
              AWS EC2 instances for application deployment and testing, and
              participated in testing and quality assurance to identify and
              resolve security flaws. This experience was super rewarding, and I
              learned a lot about integrating AI solutions into real-world
              applications, as well as the importance of feedback and asking for
              help when needed.

            Over the summer, I spent a lot of my down time exploring the hills
            and trails near my house. I love going on long walks and hikes, even
            when the California heat is barely tolerable. It's the perfect way
            to clear my mind, appreciate the beauty of nature, and maybe even
            spot a few critters if I'm lucky. I do tend to get lost pretty
            easily, but I also end up discovering new places I probably wouldn't
            have found otherwise!

            I LOVE arts and crafts! I enjoy trying all kinds of DIY projects
            (usually from Pinterest), and I’m always on the lookout for new
            ideas and inspiration. I don't think I have a favorite so far, I
            just like to make physical things with my hands, even though they
            don't always turn out as expected! I took a ceramics class in high
            school, and had so much fun taking home deformed clay objects every
            week. Recently, I've been working on small decorative items for my
            dorm, like the bow garland I made with pink construction paper and
            an absurd amount of staples. No matter how busy school gets, I
            always try to make time for crafting because it's such a relaxing
            way to express myself. I've also joined Purdue's sewing and
            woodcarving clubs this year to help channel my creativity!

            I built a full-stack web application for the Purdue ECE Faculty
            Directory to make finding faculty fast and easy. It features a clean
            React frontend with animations, backed by a Node and Express server
            that supports searching by name or research area. To improve search
            flexibility, I added wildcard, partial, and root-word matching using
            regex and porter stemming. I also built a web scraper that collects
            and caches faculty data so the app stays fast without making
            unnecessary requests. Check it out

            I built a personalized weekly task planner (heavily inspired by
            Notion) to help organize tasks by day of the week. It features a
            React and TypeScript frontend with animations and a drag-and-drop
            interface powered by the HTML5 Drag and Drop API. To improve the
            user's experience, I implemented scroll-based scaling animations
            where calendar boxes dynamically enlarge as you scroll, along with
            hover and click animations throughout the interface. The app allows
            full customization with multiple color themes (mine is set to pink
            of course), custom emoji selection that updates the favicon
            dynamically, and persistent data storage using localStorage. I also
            added an optional "other tasks" section separate from daily tasks, a
            weekend toggle, and inline task editing. Try it out
